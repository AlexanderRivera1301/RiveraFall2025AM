    <p>
      The <strong>Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum)</strong>, also known as <em>Lingzhi</em>, is a polypore fungus celebrated for its medicinal properties. 
      It has been used in traditional Asian medicine for over 2,000 years, believed to support vitality and longevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Reishi is studied for potential immune-boosting benefits, though scientific evidence is still being developed. 
      Its distinctive red, varnished appearance makes it easily recognizable in the wild.
