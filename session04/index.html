    <p id="intro">
      Mushrooms are fascinating organisms that have been used for food, medicine, and spiritual practices for centuries. Some even get cool nicknames for their "powers"!
    </p>
    <p id="highlight">

      <span class="highlight">Some are edible</span>, 
      <span class="warning">while others are toxic</span>.
