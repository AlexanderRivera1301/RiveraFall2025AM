    <h2>Traditional Use</h2>
    <p>Reishi mushrooms, known as <em>Lingzhi</em> in Chinese, have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for over 2,000 years. 
       They were often reserved for emperors and royalty due to their rarity and reputation for promoting longevity 
       (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingzhi_(mushroom)">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <p>In Chinese culture, Reishi is a symbol of good fortune, health, and spiritual power. 
       It often appears in ancient art, carvings, and temple decorations as a sacred object 
       (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707683/">NCBI</a>).</p>

    <h2>Modern Research</h2>
    <p>Today, Reishi is widely studied for its potential health benefits, including immune support, stress reduction, 
       and anti-inflammatory properties. It is commonly sold in teas, powders, and extracts 
       (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/reishi-mushroom">Healthline</a>).</p>

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Reishi mushrooms grow naturally on decaying hardwood trees, particularly oaks and maples. 
       They prefer warm, humid climates and are most commonly found in Asia, though they also appear in parts of North America and Europe 
       (<a href="https://www.fungi.com/blogs/articles/reishi-the-mushroom-of-immortality">Fungi Perfecti</a>).</p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>The Reishi mushroom has a shiny, reddish-brown surface with a distinct fan-like shape. 
       Its woody texture makes it inedible in its raw form, but it is dried and processed into supplements and teas 
       (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingzhi_(mushroom)">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
